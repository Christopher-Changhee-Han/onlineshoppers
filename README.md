# Online Shopper Purchase Intentions

Over the last decade, we have seen an exponential rise in the number of online shoppers. This number will only continue to rise as the consumer behavior moves more to digital shopping and away from brick-and-mortar shops. In this project, we use a dataset provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Shoppers+Purchasing+Intention+Dataset) to fit several machine learning algorithms to model online shoppers' purchasing behaviors. Below is a list of techniques used for a quick view:
* PostgreSQL/SQL
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* SciPy
* Sklearn
